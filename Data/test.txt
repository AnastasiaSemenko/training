There   was once a baby crocodile. He had        a beautiful shiny tail. All the other crocodiles were jealous of him.

One day the little baby crocodile counted   all his beautiful shiny scales and there were a thousand. A lot more than he thought.

He counted all the other crocodiles and there were twenty. He decided that he had many scales and could spare forty from his tummy.

He wished for forty of his scales to be on     his pillow by morning, but there were not any. Even three weeks later there were not any.

Then one day a       magic crocodile granted him a wish. He wished for forty of his scales to be on his pillow.

He woke up. There were forty beautiful shiny scales on his pillow! He gave all twenty crocodiles, two scales each.
From then on everybody was kind to the little baby crocodile.
